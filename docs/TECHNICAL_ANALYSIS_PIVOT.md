# Technical Analysis Pivot

TA is a secondary input. Discovery is driven by information pressure and positioning signals (funding, OI, orderflow) rather than static indicator catalogs.

## Current Approach
- Use regime classification (price/vol)
- Detect cross-asset divergence
- Use funding/OI skew as pressure proxies
- Use orderflow imbalance to time probes

TA indicators may be added later if they materially improve signal quality.
