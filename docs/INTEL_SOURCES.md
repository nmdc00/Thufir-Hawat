# Intel Sources

## Purpose
Define external information feeds used for discovery, context, and risk awareness.

## Active Sources
- RSS feeds (macro, policy, tech, crypto)
- Twitter/X search (optional)
- Web search + fetch (SerpAPI/Brave)

## Not Active
- Legacy comments or feeds
- Oracle-anchored market data

## Notes
- Hyperliquid orderflow and funding signals are sourced from the exchange API, not intel feeds.
- Intel sources are used for context, not event calendars.
