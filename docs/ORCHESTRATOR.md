# Orchestrator

The orchestrator coordinates planning, tool calls, reflection, and critique. It runs in trade, chat, and mentat modes with different tool permissions.

## Roles
- Planner: proposes a minimal plan
- Executor: calls tools and composes response
- Critic: sanity-checks for errors and missing risks

## Perp Focus
The orchestrator is configured for perp markets and discovery signals. Legacy market tooling has been removed from active tool lists.
